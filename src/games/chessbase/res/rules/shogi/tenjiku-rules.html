<p><b>Heavenly Tetrach</b>: The Tetrarchs is a sliding piece that skips the first square in any direction, totally ignoring (and not affecting) what is on it.

Alternatively the Tetrarchs can annihilate any opponent next to it, without moving.</p>

    <li>Annihilate any opponent standing diagonally next to it, and normally capture an opponent standing diagonally next to that ('double capture'),</li>
    <li>Stay in place without capturing anything if one of the diagonally neighboring squares is empty (effectively passing a turn)</li>
</ul>
