<h4>Carrera</h4>
<p>Pietro Carrera was an Italian author, priest, historian, and chess player. He invented this 10x8 chess variant with 2 new pieces: the Centor (later known as Archbishop) and the Champion (later known as Chancellor). This game was described in a book "Il Gioco degli Scacchi" from 1617.</p>

<h4>Capablanca</h4>
<p>José Raúl Capablanca y Graupera (1888 - 1942) was one of the greatest chess champions of all times. He invented this famous 10x8 board variant in the 1920's, introducing 2 new pieces: the Archbishop and the Chancellor.</p>

<h4>Janus </h4>
<p>Janus is the name given to the extra fairy piece used in this 10x8 chess variant. Also known as Archbishop or Cardinal, it moves and captures like Knight + Bishop. Janus Chess was invented in 1978 by Werner Schöndorf from Bildstock, Germany.</p>

<h4>Gothic</h4>
<p>Ed Trice derived this variant from Capablanca Chess in 2002 by only changing the initial setup. And patended it...</p>
<p>Hopefully the patent expired in 2006 :)</p>
