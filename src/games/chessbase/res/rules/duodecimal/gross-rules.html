<h1>Pieces</h1>
<h2>Champion</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/champion.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>The Champion leaps two spaces in any orthogonal or diagonal direction, or one space in any orthogonal direction. It is a compound of the Alfil, Dababbah, and Wazir. It was introduced in Omega Chess, and it moves the same as it does in that game.</p>

</p>
<p class='piece-details'>The Wizard moves one space diagonally or leaps to a space one file and three ranks away or three files and one rank away. It is a compound of the Ferz and the Camel. It was introduced in Omega Chess, and it moves the same as it does in that game. </p>

<h2>Marshall</h2>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="{GAME}/res/rules/fairy/chancellor.png"/>
</p>
<p class='piece-details'>It combines the move of Rook and Knight. It can be found in many, many chess variants since Carrera, Bird, Capablanca and many others like Grand Chess or Gothic Chess. (under many other names: Champion, Guard, Empress, Concubine, Chancellor, etc. The later is sometimes preferred, however it is confusing since Capablanca used it once for R+N and once for B+N. It is an Elephant in Seirawan Chess).</p>

<h1>Promotions </h1>
<p>
A Pawn may promote when it reaches any of the last three ranks, and it may promote only to a piece held in reserve. The pieces held in reserve not only include captured pieces, as they do in Grand Chess, but also two Queens, four Rooks, four Knights, and four Bishops. As with Grand Chess, the main purpose is to limit promotions to physically available pieces. The pieces from two extra Chess sets are additionally held in reserve, because you will have them on hand if you have the sets the pieces in this game come from; and this number is more than sufficient to allow all Pawns to promote.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Promotion on the tenth rank is limited to color-bound and short-range minor pieces. These are Bishops, Knights, Vaos, and Wizards.</li>
<li>Promotion on the eleventh rank is limited to these pieces plus Champions, Cannons, and Rooks.</li>
<li>Promotion to Archbishop, Marshall, or Queen is allowed only on the last rank.</li>
</ul>
</p>
